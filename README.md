# 👋 Hey there! I'm Dhanashri Chavan 🌟

> 🚀 **Curiosity Coder | Problem Solver | Forever student**

Hi! I’m Dhanashri, your friendly neighborhood Developer Advocate, on a mission to make tech accessible, secure, and simply fun!! 
I’m endlessly fascinated by the magic of AI — whether it’s coding with Copilot, exploring generative art, or building tools that learn along with us, I believe AI is not here to replace us, but to amplify our ideas and accelerate our learning.

Let’s build a future where humans and AI create, solve, and grow—together!💻✨

## 🛠️ **What I Do**
- **💼 Profession:** Developer Advocate at GitHub for our vibrant Education community ✨🏫🎒
- **📚 Skills:** Copilot, JavaScript, Cloud Architecture 
- **🚀 Interests:** Security ( I spent about 16 years in professional services + sales in the IAM Security domain and the best practices learnt there still serve me well in my current role !)

# 👋 Hey there! I'm Dhanashri Chavan 🌟

> 🚀 **Curiosity Coder | Problem Solver | Forever student**

Hi! Iʼm Dhanashri, your friendly neighborhood Developer Advocate, on a mission to make tech accessible, secure, and simply fun!! 
I specialize in enabling organizations to adopt cool solutions, particularly leveraging **AI-powered tools like GitHub Copilot** to drive innovation and productivity

My journey to DevRel is built on a solid foundation:
*   I bring **over 4 years of experience in sales** in the tech industry, which means I've spent a lot of time understanding how businesses use technology and what challenges they face
*   I have a **strong technical background**, with over 12 years of experience as a Professional Services consultant and prior engineering roles. This helps me dig into the technical side deeply and quickly adapt to new environments
*   I genuinely **love connecting with people** . Growing up in India and traveling extensively has given me a **global world view** and the ability to connect meaningfully with people from **diverse backgrounds and age groups**. This is super helpful for **building community**!
*   My background also taught me to quickly **zero in on problems** and work really well with **different teams** to help find solutions. Call it **innovative problem-solving**

Let’s build a future where humans and AI create, solve, and grow—together!💻✨
